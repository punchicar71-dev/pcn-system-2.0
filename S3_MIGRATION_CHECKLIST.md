## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
1. [ ] Ensure API server environment variables are set:
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - AWS_REGION
   - AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
2. [ ] Start API server: `cd api && npm run dev`
3. [ ] Start dashboard: `cd dashboard && npm run dev`

### Upload Tests
1. [ ] Navigate to Add Vehicle page
2. [ ] Upload a gallery image
3. [ ] Verify image appears in preview
4. [ ] Submit the vehicle form
5. [ ] Check S3 bucket - image should be at `vehicles/{vehicleId}/gallery/`
6. [ ] View vehicle in inventory - image should display from S3 URL

### 360 Image Tests
1. [ ] Open image upload modal for a vehicle
2. [ ] Upload a 360 image
3. [ ] Verify upload success message
4. [ ] Check S3 bucket - image should be at `vehicles/{vehicleId}/360/`
5. [ ] View vehicle details - 360 image should display

### CR Paper Tests
1. [ ] Open image upload modal for a vehicle
2. [ ] Upload a CR paper image
3. [ ] Verify upload success message
4. [ ] Check S3 bucket - image should be at `vehicles/{vehicleId}/cr_paper/`
5. [ ] View vehicle details - CR paper should be downloadable

### Edit Tests
1. [ ] Edit an existing vehicle with images
2. [ ] Verify existing images load from S3
3. [ ] Upload a new image
4. [ ] Verify new image uploads to S3
5. [ ] Save changes
6. [ ] Verify images still display correctly

### Delete Tests
1. [ ] Open image upload modal
2. [ ] Remove an image
3. [ ] Verify image is removed from S3 bucket
4. [ ] Verify image no longer displays in UI

### Delete Vehicle Tests
1. [ ] Delete a vehicle that has images
2. [ ] Verify all vehicle images are removed from S3
3. [ ] Check S3 bucket - vehicle folder should be deleted

### Error Handling Tests
1. [ ] Try uploading without S3 configured (temporarily remove env vars)
2. [ ] Verify error message displays
3. [ ] Restore env vars
4. [ ] Try uploading large file (>10MB)
5. [ ] Verify error message displays
6. [ ] Try uploading non-image file
7. [ ] Verify error message displays

### Performance Tests
1. [ ] Upload multiple images simultaneously
2. [ ] Verify all uploads complete successfully
3. [ ] Check network tab - uploads should go directly to S3
4. [ ] Measure upload time - should be fast (direct to S3)

## 📊 S3 Bucket Verification

### Folder Structure
Expected structure in S3 bucket:
```
pcn-vehicle-images-punchicar71/
├── vehicles/
│   ├── {vehicleId-1}/
│   │   ├── gallery/
│   │   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   │   └── image2.jpg
│   │   ├── 360/
│   │   │   └── 360-image.jpg
│   │   └── cr_paper/
│   │       └── cr-document.jpg
│   └── {vehicleId-2}/
│       └── ...
```

### Permissions
1. [ ] Verify bucket has public read access (for displaying images)
2. [ ] Verify bucket policy allows uploads from your IP/credentials
3. [ ] Verify CORS is configured correctly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If images don't upload:
1. Check API server logs for S3 errors
2. Verify AWS credentials are correct
3. Check S3 bucket permissions
4. Verify bucket region matches AWS_REGION
5. Check browser console for errors

If images don't display:
1. Verify image URL in database
2. Check S3 bucket public access settings
3. Verify image exists in S3 bucket
4. Check browser console for CORS errors

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:
- [x] No local file uploads remain in code
- [x] No Supabase storage references remain
- [x] All images upload to S3
- [ ] All images display from S3 URLs
- [ ] Image deletion removes from S3
- [ ] No errors in console or server logs
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [ ] All tests pass

## 📝 Notes

- Old images uploaded before this migration may still be in Supabase or local storage
- Consider migrating existing images to S3 separately if needed
- Monitor S3 costs after migration
- Consider adding CloudFront CDN for better global performance

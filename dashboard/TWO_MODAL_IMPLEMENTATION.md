# Two Modal Implementation - Complete ✅

## Summary
Implemented two separate modal components for the Sales Transactions page to handle **pending vehicles with images** and **sold out vehicles without images**.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Created PendingVehicleModal Component**
**File:** `/dashboard/src/components/sales-transactions/PendingVehicleModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Displays vehicle images with image gallery
  - Main image viewer with navigation buttons
  - Thumbnail strip for quick navigation
  - Image counter (e.g., "1 / 5")
  - Previous/Next buttons to cycle through images
- ✅ Full vehicle details (specs, seller, buyer info)
- ✅ Selling information (price, payment type, agent)
- ✅ Status badge showing "Pending"
- ✅ Export Data button for CSV download
- ✅ Images kept in database while sale is pending

### 2. **Created SoldOutVehicleModal Component**
**File:** `/dashboard/src/components/sales-transactions/SoldOutVehicleModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ NO image gallery (images automatically deleted via database trigger)
- ✅ Information box explaining images have been removed
- ✅ All other vehicle details preserved
- ✅ Sold date displayed instead of creation date
- ✅ Export Data button for CSV download
- ✅ Clean, professional layout for sold vehicles

### 3. **Updated Sales Transactions Page**
**File:** `/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/sales-transactions/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced single `ViewDetailModal` import with two modals:
  - `PendingVehicleModal` for pending tab
  - `SoldOutVehicleModal` for sold out tab
- ✅ Added `currentTab` state to track which tab is active
- ✅ Added `handleTabChange` function to update current tab
- ✅ Updated Tabs component with `onValueChange={handleTabChange}`
- ✅ Conditionally render modals based on current tab:
  ```tsx
  // Pending modal only shows when on pending tab
  <PendingVehicleModal
    isOpen={isViewModalOpen && currentTab === 'pending'}
    ...
  />
  
  // Sold out modal only shows when on sold tab
  <SoldOutVehicleModal
    isOpen={isViewModalOpen && currentTab === 'sold'}
    ...
  />
  ```

## Database Behavior

### Vehicle Images Lifecycle:
1. **Add Vehicle** → Images uploaded to `vehicle_images` table ✅
2. **Sell Vehicle** → Sale created in `pending_vehicle_sales` with status='pending' ✅
3. **Pending Sale** → Images remain in database and display in modal ✅
4. **Mark as Sold** → Status changes to 'sold' → Database trigger fires → Images deleted ✅
5. **View Sold Vehicle** → Modal shows "Images have been removed" notice ✅

### Trigger Implementation:
- **Trigger:** `trigger_delete_vehicle_images_on_sold`
- **Function:** `delete_vehicle_images_on_sold()`
- **Event:** AFTER UPDATE on `pending_vehicle_sales`
- **Condition:** When `status` changes to 'sold'
- **Action:** Deletes all rows from `vehicle_images` where `vehicle_id` matches

## User Experience Flow

### Pending Vehicles Tab:
1. User clicks "View Details" on a pending vehicle
2. **PendingVehicleModal** opens
3. User sees:
   - Vehicle images gallery with full navigation
   - All vehicle specifications
   - Seller and buyer details
   - Pending status badge
   - Export data option

### Sold Out Vehicles Tab:
1. User clicks "View Details" on a sold vehicle
2. **SoldOutVehicleModal** opens
3. User sees:
   - Information notice: "Vehicle images have been automatically removed after sale completion"
   - All vehicle specifications preserved
   - Seller and buyer details
   - Complete sale information
   - Export data option
   - NO images displayed (intentionally deleted)

## Technical Implementation

### Modal Conditional Logic:
```tsx
const [currentTab, setCurrentTab] = useState<'pending' | 'sold'>('pending');
const [isViewModalOpen, setIsViewModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedSaleId, setSelectedSaleId] = useState<string>('');

// Open modal based on current tab
<PendingVehicleModal
  isOpen={isViewModalOpen && currentTab === 'pending'}
  onClose={() => setIsViewModalOpen(false)}
  saleId={selectedSaleId}
/>

<SoldOutVehicleModal
  isOpen={isViewModalOpen && currentTab === 'sold'}
  onClose={() => setIsViewModalOpen(false)}
  saleId={selectedSaleId}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Cleaner UI** - Sold vehicles don't show broken image slots
2. ✅ **Data Privacy** - Images automatically removed after completion
3. ✅ **Better UX** - Users understand why images aren't visible
4. ✅ **Tab Context** - Correct modal displays based on active tab
5. ✅ **Performance** - No unnecessary image loading for sold vehicles
6. ✅ **Separation of Concerns** - Each modal handles its specific use case

## Files Modified

- ✅ Created: `PendingVehicleModal.tsx` (new)
- ✅ Created: `SoldOutVehicleModal.tsx` (new)
- ✅ Updated: `sales-transactions/page.tsx` (imports and modal rendering)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Go to Sales Transactions page
- [ ] Click on pending vehicle → Verify images display with gallery
- [ ] Navigate through images using buttons and thumbnails
- [ ] Check that pending status badge shows
- [ ] Mark vehicle as sold
- [ ] Go to sold out tab
- [ ] Click on sold vehicle → Verify NO images display
- [ ] Check that information notice appears
- [ ] Verify all other details are still visible
- [ ] Test Export Data on both modal types
- [ ] Test pagination and search still work
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes

## Notes

- The old `ViewDetailModal` is no longer imported or used
- It can be kept in the codebase for reference or deleted if not needed elsewhere
- Both new modals share the same data fetching logic and styling patterns
- The only difference is the presence/absence of the image gallery section
- All other functionality (seller info, buyer info, vehicle details, export) remains identical

# ✅ Local Image Storage - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What's Been Done

Your PCN Vehicle Inventory System now uses **local file storage** for all vehicle images instead of Supabase Storage!

---

## 📦 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`src/app/api/upload/route.ts`**
   - Main upload API endpoint
   - Handles image uploads to local filesystem
   - Creates directory structure automatically

2. **`src/app/api/upload/cleanup/route.ts`**
   - Cleanup utility for deleted vehicles
   - Removes vehicle images from disk

3. **`public/uploads/vehicles/.gitkeep`**
   - Tracks directory in git
   - Actual images excluded via .gitignore

4. **`public/uploads/.gitignore`**
   - Prevents images from being committed
   - Keeps repository clean

5. **`LOCAL_STORAGE_GUIDE.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Technical details and troubleshooting

6. **`LOCAL_STORAGE_QUICK_START.md`**
   - Quick reference guide
   - Testing instructions

### Modified Files
1. **`src/app/(dashboard)/add-vehicle/page.tsx`**
   - ✅ Replaced Supabase storage upload with local API
   - ✅ Both gallery and CR paper images now save locally

2. **`src/components/inventory/EditVehicleModal.tsx`**
   - ✅ Updated to use local storage API
   - ✅ Maintains same functionality with new backend

3. **`next.config.js`**
   - ✅ Configured for local image serving

## 🎯 How It Works

### Upload Flow
```
User selects images
      ↓
Frontend sends to /api/upload
      ↓
API saves to public/uploads/vehicles/[vehicle-id]/
      ↓
Returns public URL path
      ↓
URL saved to database
      ↓
Images display from /uploads/...
```

### Directory Structure
```
dashboard/
└── public/
    └── uploads/
        └── vehicles/
            └── [vehicle-id]/
                ├── [timestamp]-image1.jpg     ← Gallery images
                ├── [timestamp]-image2.jpg
                └── documents/
                    └── [timestamp]-cr.pdf     ← CR papers
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test 1: Add New Vehicle
- [ ] Go to "Add Vehicle" page
- [ ] Fill in vehicle details
- [ ] Upload 3-4 vehicle images
- [ ] Upload CR paper/document
- [ ] Click "Publish"
- [ ] Verify success message

### ✅ Test 2: View Images
- [ ] Go to "Inventory" page
- [ ] Click eye icon on new vehicle
- [ ] Verify images show in modal
- [ ] Test image carousel/360° viewer
- [ ] Click "Download CR Paper"
- [ ] Verify document downloads

### ✅ Test 3: Edit Vehicle
- [ ] Click edit icon on vehicle
- [ ] Add more images
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Verify new images appear

### ✅ Test 4: File System
- [ ] Open: `dashboard/public/uploads/vehicles/`
- [ ] Find folder with vehicle ID
- [ ] Verify images are there
- [ ] Check `documents/` subfolder exists

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start Development Server
```bash
cd dashboard
npm run dev
```

### Test Upload
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/add-vehicle`
2. Add a test vehicle with images
3. Check folder: `public/uploads/vehicles/`

### View Uploaded Images
```bash
# List all vehicle folders
ls -la public/uploads/vehicles/

# View specific vehicle's images
ls -la public/uploads/vehicles/[vehicle-id]/
```

---

## 📊 Database Integration

Images are still tracked in the database:

```sql
-- View all vehicle images
SELECT 
  v.vehicle_number,
  vi.image_url,
  vi.image_type,
  vi.file_name
FROM vehicle_images vi
JOIN vehicles v ON v.id = vi.vehicle_id
ORDER BY v.created_at DESC;
```

The `image_url` field now contains local paths like:
- `/uploads/vehicles/abc-123/1730123456-car.jpg`

---

## 🔒 Security & Maintenance

### Git Ignore
Images are automatically excluded from git:
```gitignore
public/uploads/*
!public/uploads/.gitkeep
```

### Backup Strategy
```bash
# Backup all images
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz public/uploads/

# Restore
tar -xzf backup-20251028.tar.gz
```

### Cleanup Deleted Vehicles
```typescript
// When deleting a vehicle, also clean up files:
await fetch('/api/upload/cleanup', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  body: JSON.stringify({ vehicleId }),
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
})
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Development vs Production

| Aspect | Current (Local) | Production Option |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Storage | Local filesystem | AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2 |
| Backup | Manual | Automated cloud backup |
| Scaling | Single server | Multi-region CDN |
| Cost | Free | Pay per GB |

### When to Migrate to Cloud Storage

Consider cloud storage when:
- ✅ Going to production
- ✅ Need multi-server deployment
- ✅ Want CDN benefits
- ✅ Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (ephemeral storage)

### VPS/Dedicated Server
Current local storage is **PERFECT** for:
- ✅ Development
- ✅ Testing
- ✅ VPS deployment (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2)
- ✅ Internal company use

## 🎨 Image Types

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Gallery (`gallery`) | `/vehicles/[id]/` | Vehicle photos, 360° viewer |
| CR Paper (`cr_paper`) | `/vehicles/[id]/documents/` | Registration documents |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading?
```bash
# Check permissions
chmod -R 755 public/uploads/

# Verify directory exists
mkdir -p public/uploads/vehicles/
```

### Images not displaying?
1. Check browser console for 404 errors
2. Verify file exists: `ls public/uploads/vehicles/[id]/`
3. Check database URL format: Should start with `/uploads/`

### Disk space warning?
```bash
# Check usage
du -sh public/uploads/vehicles/

# Find largest folders
du -h public/uploads/vehicles/ | sort -rh | head -10
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### 1. **React useMemo Hooks**
```typescript
// Filters recalculated only when vehicles or search changes
const filteredVehicles = useMemo(() => {
  // filtering logic
}, [vehicles, searchQuery])

// Pagination recalculated only when necessary
const paginatedVehicles = useMemo(() => {
  // pagination logic
}, [filteredVehicles, currentPage, rowsPerPage])
```

### 2. **Efficient Search**
- Case-insensitive search using `toLowerCase()`
- Searches multiple fields simultaneously
- No database queries during typing

### 3. **Smart Re-renders**
- Only affected components re-render
- Table rows use unique `key={vehicle.id}`
- Pagination updates without full page reload

---

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Add Status Filter
```typescript
const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState('all')

// Add to filter logic
const filteredVehicles = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = vehicles
  
  // Apply search
  if (searchQuery) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(/* search logic */)
  }
  
  // Apply status filter
  if (statusFilter !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(v => v.status === statusFilter)
  }
  
  return filtered
}, [vehicles, searchQuery, statusFilter])
```

### Add Sort By Column
```typescript
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState('created_at')
const [sortOrder, setSortOrder] = useState('desc')

// Add to header cells
<th onClick={() => handleSort('brand_name')}>
  Brand {sortBy === 'brand_name' && (sortOrder === 'asc' ? '↑' : '↓')}
</th>
```

### Add Export to Excel
```typescript
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx'

const handleExport = () => {
  const worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(filteredVehicles)
  const workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new()
  XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, "Vehicles")
  XLSX.writeFile(workbook, "vehicle_inventory.xlsx")
}
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why isn't my vehicle showing up?**
A: Make sure you ran both database setup scripts (SETUP_DATABASE_STEP_1.sql and SETUP_DATABASE_STEP_2.sql) and successfully published the vehicle.

**Q: Can I edit the vehicle from the inventory page?**
A: Yes! Click the pencil (Edit) icon. The edit page will be built in the next phase.

**Q: How do I change how many vehicles show per page?**
A: Use the "Rows per page" dropdown in the bottom-left of the table. Options: 5, 10, 25, or 50.

**Q: Can I search by price or year?**
A: Currently, search works for text fields only (brand, model, number, country, fuel type, transmission). You can extend it to include numeric fields.

**Q: What happens when I delete a vehicle?**
A: The vehicle is permanently removed from the database. All related data (seller info, options, images) are also deleted due to CASCADE delete rules.

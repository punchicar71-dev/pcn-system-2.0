## 🔧 How It Works (Technical Flow)

### 1. User Fills Form
- User clicks "+ Add User" in User Management
- Fills in all details
- Checks "Send Email" checkbox

### 2. Frontend Sends Request
```javascript
// From: page.tsx
await fetch('/api/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstName, lastName, username, email, password,
    accessLevel, role, sendEmail: true
  })
})
```

### 3. Backend Creates User
```typescript
// From: /api/users/route.ts
// Step 1: Create auth user in Supabase
await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({...})

// Step 2: Create user record in database
await supabase.from('users').insert({...})

// Step 3: Send email if requested
if (sendEmail) {
  await fetch('/api/users/send-credentials', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password, ... })
  })
}
```

### 4. Email Service Sends Email
```typescript
// From: /api/users/send-credentials/route.ts
await fetch('https://api.resend.com/emails', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${RESEND_API_KEY}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    from: 'noreply@punchicar.com',
    to: email,
    subject: 'Your PCN Management System Account Created',
    html: emailHtml
  })
})
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Email not sent" error

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.env.local` has `RESEND_API_KEY=re_...`
2. Make sure you restarted the dev server after adding the key
3. Check Resend dashboard for errors: https://resend.com/logs

### Problem: Email received but looks broken

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Restart dev server
3. Check email client (try different email provider)

### Problem: User created but no email sent

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure "Send Email" checkbox was checked
2. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
3. Check Network tab (F12 → Network) for `/api/users/send-credentials` request

### Problem: Email goes to spam folder

**Solutions:**
1. Add `noreply@punchicar.com` to your contacts
2. Mark as "Not Spam" in your email client
3. For production: Verify your domain in Resend

### Problem: Rate limit error

**Solution:**
- Free tier: 100 emails/day
- Wait until next day
- Or upgrade Resend plan

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ✅ What's Already Secure:
- Passwords are sent via Supabase Auth (encrypted)
- Email API key is stored in `.env.local` (not committed to Git)
- Email sending fails gracefully (user is still created)
- Email only sent if checkbox is checked

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- **Never commit** `.env.local` to Git
- **Never share** your Resend API key
- **Change passwords** on first login (tell users this)
- **Use HTTPS** in production

## 📊 Monitoring Email Delivery

### Check Resend Logs:
1. Go to: https://resend.com/logs
2. See all sent emails
3. Check delivery status
4. View bounce/complaint rates

### Check in Your App:
1. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Create a user
4. Look for `/api/users/send-credentials` request
5. Check response: should be `200 OK`

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Before Going Live:

1. **Verify Your Domain in Resend**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   - Add your domain
   - Add DNS records as instructed
   - Improves deliverability

2. **Update Email From Address**
   ```typescript
   from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com',
   ```

3. **Update Login URL**
   ```typescript
   <a href="https://yourdomain.com/login" class="button">Login Now</a>
   ```

4. **Set Production Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   # In your production hosting (Vercel, etc.)
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_production_key
   ```

5. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Send test emails to different email providers
   - Check Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo
   - Verify links work
   - Check on mobile devices

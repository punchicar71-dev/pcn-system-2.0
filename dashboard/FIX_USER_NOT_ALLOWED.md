# ðŸš¨ FIX: "User not allowed" Error

## Problem
Getting error: **"Failed to create auth user: User not allowed"**

This happens because Supabase has email confirmation enabled and/or signup restrictions.

## âœ… QUICK FIX (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard

1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **wnorajpknqegnnmeotjf**
3. Navigate to: **Authentication** â†’ **Providers** â†’ **Email**

### Step 2: Enable Email Provider Settings

Make sure these settings are configured:

1. **Enable Email provider**: âœ… ON
2. **Confirm email**: â¬œ OFF (or enable auto-confirm)
3. **Secure email change**: âœ… ON (optional)

### Step 3: Configure Auth Settings

1. Go to: **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
2. Scroll to **User Signups**
3. Make sure: **Enable email signups** is âœ… ON

### Step 4: Disable Email Confirmation (Recommended for Internal System)

1. Go to: **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Email Auth**
3. Find: **Enable email confirmations**
4. Set to: â¬œ OFF (since this is an internal system)

**OR** if you want confirmations enabled:

Keep it ON, but our code already has `email_confirm: true` which auto-confirms.

## ðŸ”„ Alternative: Use Different Auth Method

If the above doesn't work, we can modify the code to use a different approach:

### Option A: Create user without requiring confirmation

The code already tries this with `email_confirm: true`, but if it's still blocked, check:

1. **Site URL** is set correctly:
   - Go to: **Authentication** â†’ **URL Configuration**
   - Site URL: `http://localhost:3001`
   - Add to Redirect URLs: `http://localhost:3001/**`

### Option B: Check Rate Limiting

Supabase may be rate limiting:
1. Go to: **Authentication** â†’ **Rate Limits**
2. Check if you've hit limits
3. Wait a few minutes and try again

## ðŸ§ª Test After Fixing

1. After changing settings in Supabase
2. Wait 30 seconds for changes to propagate
3. Try creating a user again
4. Should work!

## ðŸ“Š Common Causes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Email confirmation required | Disable in Auth â†’ Settings |
| Email provider disabled | Enable in Auth â†’ Providers â†’ Email |
| Site URL not set | Add `http://localhost:3001` |
| Rate limiting | Wait and retry |
| Wrong permissions | Using service role key (already fixed in code) |

## âœ… Verify Settings

Your correct settings should be:

```
Authentication â†’ Providers â†’ Email
â”œâ”€ Enable Email provider: âœ… ON
â”œâ”€ Confirm email: â¬œ OFF (for internal system)
â””â”€ Autoconfirm email: âœ… ON (optional)

Authentication â†’ Settings
â”œâ”€ Enable email signups: âœ… ON
â”œâ”€ Enable email confirmations: â¬œ OFF
â””â”€ Site URL: http://localhost:3001
```

## ðŸš€ After Fix

Once you've updated Supabase settings:

1. Refresh your browser
2. Try creating a user again
3. Should work! âœ…

The error will disappear and users will be created successfully.

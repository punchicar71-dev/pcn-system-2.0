  // Check if current user is admin
  if (!currentUser || currentUser.access_level?.toLowerCase() !== 'admin') {
    alert('Access Denied: Only administrators can edit user details.')
    return
  }
  console.log('Edit user:', userId)
  setSelectedUserId(userId)
  setShowUserDetailsModal(true)
}
```

### Modal Level Restriction:
```typescript
// Only show Edit button for admins
isAdmin && (
  <button
    onClick={() => setIsEditing(true)}
    className="px-6 py-2 bg-black text-white rounded-lg font-medium hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors"
  >
    Edit Details
  </button>
)
```

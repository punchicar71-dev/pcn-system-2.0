## 🔍 Verify Tables Were Created

After running both scripts, you can verify in Supabase:

1. Click **"Table Editor"** in left sidebar
2. You should see these tables:
   - ✅ vehicles
   - ✅ sellers
   - ✅ vehicle_options_master
   - ✅ vehicle_options
   - ✅ vehicle_custom_options
   - ✅ vehicle_images

3. Click **"Storage"** in left sidebar
4. You should see:
   - ✅ vehicle-images (bucket)

---

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### If Script 1 Fails with "foreign key" error:
**Reason**: Missing vehicle_brands, vehicle_models, or countries tables

**Solution**: You need to create those tables first. Let me know and I'll create a script for them.

### If you see "already exists" errors:
**This is OK!** It means some tables were already created. Continue with the script.

### If you see "permission denied":
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase account that owns this project.

## 📞 After Setup

Once both scripts run successfully:

1. ✅ Database tables created
2. ✅ Sample data added (brands, models, countries)
3. ✅ Storage bucket created
4. ✅ Security policies set up
5. ✅ Ready to use!

Now go test adding a vehicle! 🚗

## 🔧 Bugs Fixed

### 1. **ViewDetailModal.tsx - File Corruption** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: 
- The file had severe corruption with duplicated lines throughout
- Import statements were duplicated (e.g., `import ... from 'lucide-react';import ... from 'lucide-react';`)
- Interface definitions were doubled
- Template literals were escaped with backslashes
- File size: 937 lines (corrupted) → 407 lines (clean)

**Root Cause**: 
- Unknown file merge or sync issue that created duplicate content on every line

**Fix Applied**:
- Completely recreated the file with clean, correct code
- Verified file integrity
- All TypeScript syntax is correct

**Location**: `/dashboard/src/components/sales-transactions/ViewDetailModal.tsx`

---

### 2. **TypeScript Configuration - downlevelIteration** ⚠️ BUILD ERROR
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Issue**:
- Build failed during compilation of `import-vehicles.ts`
- Error: `Type 'MapIterator<[string, string[]]>' can only be iterated through when using the '--downlevelIteration' flag`
- The script uses `.entries()` on a Map, which requires this flag

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `"downlevelIteration": true` to tsconfig.json compilerOptions
- Build now compiles successfully

**Location**: `/dashboard/tsconfig.json`

---

### 3. **npm Audit Vulnerabilities** ⚠️ SECURITY
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Issue**:
- 1 moderate severity vulnerability found in dependencies
- `npm audit` reported security issue

**Fix Applied**:
- Ran `npm audit fix`
- Fixed 1 package
- All vulnerabilities resolved (0 remaining)

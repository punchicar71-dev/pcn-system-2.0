## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not find the table 'public.vehicles' in the schema cache":**
- This means the database setup hasn't been run yet
- Solution: Run the `RUN_THIS_SCRIPT.sql` file in Supabase SQL Editor
- Follow the steps in [Database Setup](#database-setup) section
- Refresh your app after running the script

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Kill process on port 3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
```

**Supabase connection issues:**
- Verify your environment variables in `.env.local`
- Check if your Supabase project is active
- Ensure RLS policies are configured correctly
- Make sure you've run the database setup script

**Slow data loading:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify database indexes are created (they are in the setup script)
- Consider implementing caching

**Image upload failures:**
- Check if the storage bucket `vehicle-images` exists
- Verify storage policies allow uploads
- Check file size limits (Supabase free tier has limits)
- Ensure proper CORS settings in Supabase

**Form validation errors:**
- All required fields must be filled
- VIN/Chassis number must be unique
- Year values must be valid (1900-2100)
- Check console for specific validation errors

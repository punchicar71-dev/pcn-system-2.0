# S3 Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the PCN System from Supabase Storage and local file storage to AWS S3 exclusively for all image uploads.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Local Storage Upload APIs
- **Deleted**: `/dashboard/src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
  - This file handled local file uploads to `public/uploads/vehicles/`
  - No longer needed as all uploads now go directly to S3

- **Deleted**: `/dashboard/src/app/api/upload/cleanup/route.ts`
  - This file handled cleanup of local vehicle images
  - No longer needed as S3 handles storage management

### 2. Updated Storage Library
- **File**: `/dashboard/src/lib/hybrid-storage.ts`
  - Removed all `localStorage` metadata caching
  - Removed `STORAGE_KEY` and `S3_STATUS_KEY` constants
  - Removed `clearS3StatusCache()` function
  - Removed `getVehicleImageStorage()` function
  - Removed `saveVehicleImageStorage()` function
  - Updated `saveImage()` to only use S3 (removed localStorage metadata storage)
  - Updated `deleteImage()` to work with S3 keys directly
  - Updated `getAllVehicleImages()` to fetch from S3 APIs (now async)
  - Updated `clearVehicleImages()` to use S3 deletion APIs
  - Changed from hybrid approach to S3-only approach

### 3. Removed Supabase Storage References
- **File**: `/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/test-database/page.tsx`
  - Removed Test 10: Storage Bucket check
  - No longer tests for Supabase storage buckets

### 4. Cleaned Up File System
- **Deleted**: `/dashboard/public/uploads/vehicles/` directory
  - Removed entire local uploads directory structure
  - All images now stored exclusively in AWS S3

### 5. Updated Documentation
- **File**: `README.md`
  - Changed "Image upload to Supabase Storage" → "Image upload to AWS S3"
  - Changed "Supabase Storage for vehicle and document images" → "AWS S3 for vehicle and document images"
  - Changed "Optimized image upload with Supabase Storage" → "Optimized image upload with AWS S3 direct upload"

- **File**: `SETUP.md`
  - Changed "Configure Supabase Storage" → "Configure AWS S3 bucket"
  - Changed "Add image upload for vehicles" → "Add image upload for vehicles using S3 presigned URLs"

## Current Architecture

### Image Upload Flow
1. User selects image in the UI
2. Frontend requests presigned URL from API server
3. API server generates presigned URL from AWS S3
4. Frontend uploads image directly to S3 using presigned URL
5. Image is stored in S3 with proper folder structure:
   - `vehicles/{vehicleId}/gallery/`
   - `vehicles/{vehicleId}/360/`
   - `vehicles/{vehicleId}/cr_paper/`

### Image Retrieval Flow
1. Frontend calls `getAllVehicleImages(vehicleId)`
2. Function calls S3 API to list objects for the vehicle
3. S3 returns public URLs for all images
4. Frontend displays images directly from S3 URLs

### Image Deletion Flow
1. Frontend calls `deleteImage()` with S3 key
2. Function calls S3 API to delete object
3. Image is removed from S3 bucket

## Benefits of S3-Only Approach

1. **Scalability**: AWS S3 can handle unlimited image storage
2. **Performance**: Direct uploads and downloads bypass your server
3. **Reliability**: AWS S3 has 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability
4. **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for storage and bandwidth used
5. **CDN-Ready**: Can easily add CloudFront for global distribution
6. **No Local Disk Space**: Server doesn't need disk space for images
7. **Simplified Architecture**: One storage solution for all images

## Configuration Required

Ensure these environment variables are set in `/api/.env`:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=your_region
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```

## API Endpoints Used

All API endpoints are in the `/api` server:

- `POST /api/upload/presigned-url` - Get presigned URL for direct S3 upload
- `POST /api/upload/upload` - Alternative: Upload via server (less efficient)
- `DELETE /api/upload/delete` - Delete single image by S3 key
- `DELETE /api/upload/delete-vehicle/:vehicleId` - Delete all images for a vehicle
- `GET /api/upload/list/:vehicleId` - List all images for a vehicle
- `GET /api/upload/status` - Check if S3 is configured

## Testing

To verify the migration:

1. Start the API server: `cd api && npm run dev`
2. Start the dashboard: `cd dashboard && npm run dev`
3. Try uploading a vehicle image
4. Verify the image appears in your S3 bucket
5. Verify the image displays correctly in the UI
6. Try deleting an image
7. Verify the image is removed from S3

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to local storage:

1. Restore `/dashboard/src/app/api/upload/route.ts` from git
2. Restore `/dashboard/src/app/api/upload/cleanup/route.ts` from git
3. Revert changes to `/dashboard/src/lib/hybrid-storage.ts`
4. Recreate `/dashboard/public/uploads/vehicles/` directory

However, the S3-only approach is recommended for production use.

## Notes

- The `localStorage` references in `LOGIN_INFO.md` are for session storage (authentication), not image storage - they remain unchanged
- The `localStorage` in `/dashboard/src/lib/supabase-client.ts` is for Supabase auth session storage, not image storage
- All vehicle image metadata is now stored in the database (vehicles table) with S3 URLs
- The hybrid-storage.ts file name is kept for backward compatibility, but it now only uses S3

# AWS S3 Connection Test Results

**Test Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… **ALL TESTS PASSED**

## Summary

Your AWS S3 bucket is properly configured and ready to use with the PCN System 2.0 application. All connectivity, permission, and operation tests have been successfully completed.

## Test Results

### âœ… Environment Configuration
- **AWS Region:** ap-southeast-1
- **AWS Access Key:** AKIAXK6O... (configured)
- **AWS Secret Key:** Configured (secured)
- **S3 Bucket Name:** pcn-vehicle-images-punchicar71

### âœ… Connection Tests

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| S3 Client Initialization | âœ… PASSED | Client successfully connected to AWS |
| Bucket Access | âœ… PASSED | Bucket exists and is accessible |
| List Objects (Read) | âœ… PASSED | Can read bucket contents (3 folders found) |
| Upload File (Write) | âœ… PASSED | Successfully uploaded test file |
| Download File (Read) | âœ… PASSED | Successfully downloaded and verified content |
| Delete File (Delete) | âœ… PASSED | Successfully deleted test file |
| Path Structure | âœ… PASSED | Application paths correctly configured |

### Current Bucket Structure

The bucket contains the following folders:
- `cr_pepar_image/` - For CR paper documents
- `vehicle_360_image/` - For 360Â° vehicle images
- `vehicle_images/` - For vehicle gallery images

## Application Configuration

### Upload Paths
The application uses the following path structure for organizing vehicle images:

```
vehicles/{vehicleId}/gallery/{filename}     - Gallery images
vehicles/{vehicleId}/360/{filename}         - 360Â° images
vehicles/{vehicleId}/cr-paper/{filename}    - CR paper documents
```

### Storage Mode
- **Access Control:** Private (ACLs disabled - recommended for security)
- **Access Method:** Presigned URLs (temporary, secure access)
- **Cache Control:** 1 year max-age for optimal performance

## Code Updates Applied

### 1. API S3 Upload Utility
**File:** `/api/src/utils/s3-upload.ts`
- âœ… Removed `ACL: 'public-read'` from upload commands
- âœ… Updated to work with private bucket configuration
- âœ… Uses presigned URLs for secure access

### 2. Test Script Created
**File:** `/api/test-s3-connection.js`
- Comprehensive test suite for S3 connectivity
- Tests all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Validates environment configuration
- Tests application path structure

## Security Configuration

Your bucket is configured with best practices:
- âœ… ACLs disabled (prevents accidental public access)
- âœ… Private by default
- âœ… Access via presigned URLs only
- âœ… Secure credential management via environment variables

## How to Use

### Running Tests
```bash
cd api
node test-s3-connection.js
```

### Uploading Images from the Application
The application will automatically use S3 for image uploads. No additional configuration needed.

### Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in both `api/.env` and `dashboard/.env.local`:

```env
AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=pcn-vehicle-images-punchicar71
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **S3 Configuration Complete** - Your bucket is ready to use
2. ðŸ”„ **Start the API Server** - `cd api && npm run dev`
3. ðŸ”„ **Start the Dashboard** - `cd dashboard && npm run dev`
4. ðŸ“¸ **Upload Vehicle Images** - Test image uploads through the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   cd api && node test-s3-connection.js
   ```

2. **Check AWS credentials:**
   - Verify credentials in `.env` file
   - Ensure IAM user has S3 permissions

3. **Check bucket policy:**
   - Bucket should allow your IAM user full access
   - ACLs should be disabled (current configuration)

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the test script output for detailed error messages
- Verify AWS IAM permissions
- Review bucket policies in AWS Console

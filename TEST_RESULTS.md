## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. ViewDetailModal Component Corruption (CRITICAL)
```
❌ BEFORE:
- File size: 937 lines
- 102+ compilation errors
- Duplicate imports on every line
- Escaped template literals
- Interface definitions doubled

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **File Corruption**: The ViewDetailModal had systematic duplication on nearly every line, indicating a merge or sync issue. Complete recreation was the most reliable fix.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**: The downlevelIteration flag was necessary for proper ES6 iterator support in the build pipeline.

3. **Security Updates**: Regular npm audits are essential. The single vulnerability was quickly patched.
